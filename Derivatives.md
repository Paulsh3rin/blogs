## What are Derivatives ?
**Derivatives** are financial instruments. They are essentially financial contracts between two or more parties. Like the name, they derive their value from an underlying asset. The underlying asset could be stocks, bonds, commodities, currency or interest rates or could even be weather condition. 

### Types:
1. **Futures**

    A future contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future date for a price that is agreed upon today. However futures have obligations.
2. **Options**

    An option gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset before a future date. There are two types of options:
    
    * **Call option**: Gives yoy the right to buy an asset at a set price.
    * **Put option**: Gives you the right to sell an asset at a set price. 
3. **Swaps**

    A swap is a contract where two parties agrees to exchange cash flows in the future based on different financial instruments (*Interest rates, Currencies, commodities, real estate, volatility, inflation, Credit risk*).
4. **Forwards**

    Forwards are similar to futures but are private agreements, customizable, and lacks the regulatory oversight that future contracts have.

### Purpose:
    
1. **Hedging (Reducing Risk)**:

     Imagine a company that imports raw materials from another country. They might use a currency derivative to lock in today’s exchange rate to avoid the risk of a future increase in the foreign currency’s price.
2. **Speculation (Making Profit)**:

    Some people use derivatives to bet on the future price movement of an asset. They hope to make money if the price moves in the direction they predict.
3. **Arbitrage (Exploiting Price Difference)**:

    Some traders use derivatives to profit from price differences in different markets or instruments.

### Risk:

While derivatives can be used to reduce risk (hedging), they can also increase risk if used recklessly. Because they often involve leverage (borrowing money to invest), small changes in the price of the underlying asset can lead to significant gains—or losses.
